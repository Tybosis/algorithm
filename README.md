algorithm
=========
For this assignment I created an educational webpage about the bubble sort algorithm and included my visualization of
how bubble sort works.  The user is able to enter a value from 1 to 20 (for formatting reasons) whoch will visualize a
new array and when the user clicks the button, the array will be bubble sorted!
