algorithm
=========
For this assignment I created an educational webpage about the bubble sort algorithm and included my visualization of
how bubble sort works.  The user is able to enter a value from 1 to 20 (for formatting reasons) whoch will visualize a
new array and when the user clicks the button, the array will be bubble sorted! The button styling came from tweaking this basic code: http://usabilitypost.com/2012/01/10/pressed-button-state-with-css3/. I also got help from various stackoverflow threads, the w3schools.com website, and the api.jquery pages.
